Ranging across eras and cultures, the books here reveal his late thoughts about history, myth, legend, faith, love, and desire. He had never been more popular, and the founding of the Browning Society in 1881 expanded both his audience and his sense of his place in English letters. The first title in Volume XV is Dramatic Idylls, Second Series (1880). Taking his subjects from classical history, colonial India, Arabian legend, medieval sorcery, Jewish folk tales, and Greek myth, Browning startles the reader with the rapidity of his thought and the inventiveness of his art. In Jocoseria (1883) Browning's subjects range across time and space from Hebraic legend to the England of the Romantics. Such variety helped attract new readers: Jocoseria was immediately successful, and a second edition was printed in the same year as the first. Although Browning's next volume, Ferishtah's Fancies (1884), was so popular that three editions were printed in less than two years, this artful string of anecdotes and lyrics has attracted little favorable criticism. The materials--Persian legends and Arabic backgrounds--chimed with the wildly popular Orientalism of FitzGerald's Rubáiyát, Whistler's Peacock Room, and Alma-Tadema's paintings. But the thought was pure Browning in his most optimistic vein, and not at all in tune with the growing pessimism of the day. As always in this series of critical editions, a complete record of textual variants is provided, as well as extensive explanatory notes."--Publisher's description. 0aEnglish poetryy19th century.1 aKing, Roma A.q(Roma Alvah),d1914-1 aHerring, Jack W.,d1925-08iOnline version:aBrowning, Robert, 1812-1889.sPoems.tComplete works of Robert Browning.dAthens : Ohio University Press, 1969-<2008>w(OCoLC)557436894  a.b10214239b900717c180710  abeatb160310cmdae-fenggohuh4  a-  a92bSCL  cv.1g1i0114400932062j0lbeat o-p$0.00s-t0u2v2w0x0y.i10214574z900717  cv.3g1i0114402365956j0lbeat o-p$0.00s-t0u1v0w0x0y.i12003475z920218  cv.2g1i0114402505476j0lbeat o-p$0.00s-t0u0v0w0x0y.i12030788z920318  cv.4g1i0114402505467j0lbeat o-p$0.00s-t0u0v0w0x0y.i1203079xz920318
