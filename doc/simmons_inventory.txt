This document will lay out the process for getting Simmons University's instances, holdings and items into FOLIO.

1. Convert MARC records

  All records must be in utf8 format to load properly into FOLIO-- yaz-marcdump will do the trick.  Here is a one-liner
  that will accomplish our conversion:

  $ yaz-marcdump -f marc8 -t utf8 -l 9=97 -o marc SimmonsBibRecords.mrc > SimConv.mrc

  What's happening above?
  -f = from "marc8"
  -t = to "utf8"
  -l = leader byte 9 is set to ascii char 97 ("a").  This indicates that we're dealing with a utf8 record
  -o = output is "marc" binary.  By default it will be outputted as MARC text.
  SimmonsBibRecords.mrc is the input file.
  > = direct output SimConv.mrc

2. Create instance records

  There are two ways to do this: convert records locally and use the various APIs to load json records
  into FOLIO, or use FOLIO data import API which will do the conversion for you, with default mapping.
  Regardless, holdings and items need to be converted locally.

  The local method using marc2inst.pl (located /folio-import/perl/).  This script requires three arguments:
  1. Mapping_rules path (you can download the default mapper with /folio-import/bash/get_mapping_rules.sh)
  2. Reference directory -- this is the directory were reference json files are located (use reference_inventory.sh)
  3. Path to MARC file -- This would be the utf8 binary file created by the above steps.

  Ex: $ ./marc2inst.pl ../mapping_rules/sim.json ../data/SIMREF/ ../../SIM/Bibs/SimConv.mrc

  This script will run for a while and echo record pos and title to the terminal.  This script will die
  if certain reference mappings are not found.
